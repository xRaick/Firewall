# AutoCreateAllowRules.ps1

This PowerShell script dynamically updates Windows Firewall rules based on the latest IP address allocations from the RIPE NCC (RÃ©seaux IP EuropÃ©ens Network Coordination Centre). It focuses on creating allow rules for IPv4 ranges belonging to specific European countries (e.g. DE, FR, BE, LU).

## âœ¨ Features

- Downloads and parses the latest RIPE NCC IPv4 allocation file.
- Converts address blocks into optimal CIDR notation.
- Automatically creates or replaces inbound Windows Firewall rules for each country.
- Splits large rule sets into manageable batches (if more than 10,000 IPs).
- Logs all operations, including errors and rule creation summaries.
